R package
===

1. Write a R function to generate [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). The function should accept one parameter, the length of the series _N_, and should return the series as a result.
2. Check out the R package [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) and write the documentation for your Fibonacci function. 
3. Check out the R package testthat, and write a test function to make sure that your function returns the series correctly, and only positive values of  _N_ are are accepted.
4. Package the function into your package with a name that you choose freely. Check out the online book [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham for a guide.
