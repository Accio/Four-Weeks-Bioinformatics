Differential gene expression with seqencing data
===

We had previously learned how to perform differential gene expression with microarray data. Today we learn how to do that with count data that come from technologies such as RNA-sequencing.

To start have a look at the vignette of the (_edgeR_ package)[http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html] in Bioconductor.

Next, try to analyse the differential gene expression using the data provided in the folder.
