Linux
===

1. Install a Linux distribution (tip: MINT or UBUNTU) in a Virtual Machine using either VMWare or VirtualBox (you need admin right to do that)
2. Make yourself familiar with Linux. Check out both GUI (=graphical user interface) tools and command-line tools.
3. Make yourself familiar with command-line tools, including __ls__, __cd__, _etc_, using on-line tools such as [LinuxCommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org/).
4. Check-out either  __emacs__ or __vim__ for file editting.
5. In particular, try to make yourself familiar with command-line tools __grep__, __sed__, and __awk__. They will be valuable to manipulate files. For __awk__, I recommend [this article by Daniel Robbins posted on IBM developerWorks](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-awk1/index.html).
