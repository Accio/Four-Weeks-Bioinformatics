Day 4
===

Today we will continue the exercise yesterday

1. Compare gene expression of tip cells versus endothelial stalk cells in two ways: first model the expression of all three cell types (including the control) with one linear model, and derive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the comparison between tip and stalk cells; next exclude the control cells and model the tip and stalk cells only, and derive DEGs again. 
2. Compare the DEGs and statistics (t-statistic, p-Value, logFC): what is your observation?
3. Can you explain your observation?
