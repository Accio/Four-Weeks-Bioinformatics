Gene set enrichment analysis
===

1. Get familiar with the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Tool ([weblink](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp), first described in [A. Subramanian _et al._](http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545.full))
2. Using MSigDB gene sets, identify differentially expressed gene sets using GSEA between stalk and tip cells.
3. Use heatmaps and other visual techniques to visualise differences of genes in a selected pathway. 
4. Learn the [CAMERA method](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/40/17/e133/2411151/Camera-a-competitive-gene-set-test-accounting-for) by Wu and Smyth for gene-set enrichment analysis, and re-run the analysis with CAMERA. Compare the results.
